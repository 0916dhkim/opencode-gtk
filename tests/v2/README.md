# OpenCode 2.0.8 test harness

Runs a real, isolated `@opencode/cli@2.0.8` server (npm SHA-512 verified at build time) next to a
scripted OpenAI-compatible mock provider, on the internal Docker network `ocgtk-v2h-net` (no egress).

```sh
tests/v2/harness.sh build
tests/v2/harness.sh up --state /path/outside/repo      # writes <state>/password (0600)
tests/v2/harness.sh capture --state /path/outside/repo # rewrites tests/fixtures/v2-2.0.8/
tests/v2/harness.sh status
tests/v2/harness.sh down --state /path/outside/repo
```

- Server: `http://ocgtk-v2h-server:4096`, Basic auth user `opencode`, random per-`up` password.
  Other containers reach it by joining `ocgtk-v2h-net`; no host port is published.
- Server state (HOME/XDG/DB) lives on tmpfs and is gone after `down`. The workspace is a fresh git
  repo seeded from `workspace/` at `/state/workspace`; the server's cwd is `/state/home`.
- Config: `opencode.json` (mock provider `mock/mock-model` and `mock/mock-model-alt`, the built-in
  `opencode` provider plugin removed, `websearch: false`, `shell` asks, `question` denied last).
- `capture --out DIR` writes elsewhere (for example to diff two runs).

## End-to-end run

```sh
tests/v2/e2e.sh --state /path/outside/repo [--shots DIR] [--build] [--skip-gui]
```

Brings the harness up, runs the ignored live API test (`src/api/live_tests.rs`, through the
client's own `Api` and transcript reducer: bootstrap, models, create/rename, the text, reasoning,
tools, error, retry, attachment, model-switch, permission, subagent, child-permission and
slow+interrupt scenarios, form pending/cancel, history paging, and the background jobs list (a shell from `POST /api/shell`, background and
foreground subagents); each checks that the live transcript equals a reload) in the builder image, then restarts the harness and runs
`gui_smoke.sh` (the app under Xvfb sends one `[[scenario:text]]` prompt by keyboard; the server
must then hold the user prompt and a reply; screenshot in `--shots`). The harness is always taken
down at the end. Both run on `ocgtk-v2h-net` behind `loopback.py` (listening on
`127.0.0.1:14096`, never 4096/4097, which are real servers' ports on a developer host; the scripts
fail if it cannot bind), because the client accepts plain HTTP only on loopback. The live test
refuses to run unless `OCGTK_V2H_HARNESS=1` is set, which only `e2e.sh` does. `OCGTK_V2H_PREFIX`
(default `ocgtk-v2h`) renames the harness containers and network, so two runs can coexist. `E2E_CARGO_VOLUME`/`E2E_TARGET_VOLUME` pick the builder's cache volumes.
Not part of CI: the harness image downloads the pinned CLI when it is built.

## Mock provider scenarios

`mock_provider.py` serves `POST /v1/chat/completions` (streaming). Put a marker in the prompt:

| Marker | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| none / `[[scenario:text]]` | short text reply |
| `[[scenario:reasoning]]` | `reasoning_content` deltas, then text |
| `[[scenario:tools]]` | two tool calls in one step (`read` README.md, `glob` `**/*.txt`), then text |
| `[[scenario:permission]]` | `shell` call that hits the `ask` rule |
| `[[scenario:subagent]]` | background `subagent` call; the child replies with text |
| `[[scenario:subagent-permission]]` | foreground `subagent` whose child calls `shell` (child permission) |
| `[[scenario:error]]` | HTTP 500 with `x-should-retry: false` |
| `[[scenario:retry]]` | first attempt 503 (`x-should-retry: true`), then text |
| `[[scenario:slow]]` | 20 deltas, 0.5 s apart |
| `[[scenario:long]]` | 300 deltas |

Requests without tools (title generation, compaction) get a short plain reply. `GET /_log` on the
mock returns every request it received; `POST /_reset` clears it.
